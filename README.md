## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA DEPENDENCIES` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-pack/blob/master/release-notes/v0.9.0.md#work-with-jar-files-directly).


## About project

This was a project I have done for school to test AI algorithms.

I think this library I created in Node file is quite easy to understand and can be implemented
in a better GUI than I created.

The primary goal for GUI was to get some points for creating GUI. I can make it better, but for now
I do not have enough time to invest in polishing or better said the horrendous interface I developed.

Feel free to use my libraries for AI or nodes modeling.
